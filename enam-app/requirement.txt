# AgriTrade - Project Setup & Requirements

Welcome to the AgriTrade project! This document outlines how a new developer can clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and run the project locally.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18.x or higher is recommended)
- npm (comes installed with Node.js)
- Git

## Necessary Libraries (Already in package.json)
The project is built using modern web development tools. All required libraries are listed in `package.json` and are automatically managed via npm. Some of the core dependencies include:
- `next`: React Framework for production
- `react` & `react-dom`: UI Library
- `firebase`: Authentication, Database, and Backend services
- `tailwindcss`: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- `framer-motion`: For smooth UI animations
- `lucide-react`: For iconography
- `recharts`: For data visualization and charts
- `react-hot-toast`: For elegant popup notifications

Since all these dependencies are already defined in your `package.json`, **no additional libraries need to be manually added**. The application is fully equipped to run as-is.

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder_name>
```
*(If you already have the folder, just navigate into it like `cd enam-app`)*

### 2. Install Dependencies
Once inside the project directory, install all the required Node.js libraries by running:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables
The project requires Firebase to function properly. Ensure you have the `.env.local` file in the root of your project directory. It should contain your Firebase configuration keys:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id_here
```

### 4. Run the Development Server
Start the Next.js local development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will now start running. Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view and interact with the app.
